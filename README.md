## Site Structure

 The style of this site will be simple and clear due to over saturation of the fitness industry. The aim is to stand out  on our four principles and our inclusive community.
 
 It consists of 3 formatted pages consisting of a hero image, a main description surrounded by the four concept images. The next section is Classes followed by four images with location and times. This is then is followed by the footer with contact details and a google map. There is also two other pages, the other being a picture gallery and the other a sign up form

## Design Choices

### Typography
The fonts chosen for this project were 'dm-serif-display' for the headings (h1, h2 etc) and 'sans-serif' for the body text. The reason for this is that account I want to text to stand out. When you navigate to the page it stands out. Also I did not want to fill the landed page with text, I wanted to images to speak volumes in terms of community and inclusively
 


[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Colour Scheme
The choices for the color scheme were based on examination of other like purpose sites. I wanted a contrast of dark and light across the site. I used a light background color to make the images stand out around this background color. As you can see I did ue a different background color in contrast to the body. The purpose of this was that the contact details would standout on the site and be easily located by the text and background of the footer. AS you can the text was in two colors, for the images I had the text in light color to make them stand out against the images

### Sub-sections
  -   The main page is divided into three sections. First as I have discussed already. Below this will be the about us. Here I focus on the four pillars, nutrition, well being, education , movement. On a mobile screen these will stack on top of one another for easy viewing

### Sub-sections
  -   The second subsection here is providing insight to some classes available with locations and times also. I used the layout used from Love Running. I used flex box and used an opacity on the images the bring forward the white text to make it pop out. Similar to above for mobile view these images stack evenly on top of each other.

## Features Left to Implement
 
This site was initially conceived as a public information resource with an option for adaptation depending on user feedback. Some of the features that are intended for the future without feedback are as follows:
 
- Live walk through of the studio so the end user can get the video picture of what to expect
- Advice board where collected tips will be displayed.
- Animation/Pop-up highlighting the user to book now to avoid disappointment 
- Self produced media content: videos and photos to replace all externally sourced content. 
- A possible link for a bank of tutorial videos for all members including exercise work shops, nutrition tips

## Testing

In the building of the site, the major issues I had to deal with involved the following :



- Menu layout and presentation on smaller viewpoints
  - Due to my lack of knowledge of view points. I built my project around full screen and not smaller screens. This impacted my times frame of worked needed. I then had to re-scale for my project to be viewed on smaller screens. I have now learnt to build on smaller view points and then build outwards to large view points 


- 'Read Me FILE'
  - Initially on commencing this project I did not have a full visual. I did not complete the read me initially. I know understand the importance of having this completed as this gives clear direction and focus of the project.


## Validator Testing

  ### HTML with W3C validator
    - index.html

   No errors or warnings on index.html page. 
    
  ![Validator](assets/readme%20images/main.html%20validator.PNG)
    
    

    - gallery.html

    No errors or warnings on gallery page
   
  ![Validator](/assets/readme%20images/gallery.html%20validator.PNG)

    - sign-up.html

   No errors or warnings on sign up page

  ![Corrected](/assets/readme%20images/sign-up.html%20validator.PNG)
   
    

  ### CSS with (Jigsaw) validator

  ![W3C CSS Validator Results](/assets/readme%20images/css%20validator.PNG)

    

  ### Lighthouse Validator
  
    The following images show the results from the Lighthouse Developer Tool based on desktop and mobile standards respectively.

  ![Lighthouse Desktop 1260 Result ](/assets/readme_images/lighthouseIndexScore.jpg)

    Measuring the criteria of Performance, Accessibility, Best Practice and SEO, the results have varied depending on the screensize that the site was assessed through. Part of the issues highlighted include the lack of defined dimensions for the images within the site. Due to the aforementioned issues with column formatting, some of the original measurements have been removed in an attempt to rectify the issue. 

  ![Lighthouse Mobile 320 Result](/assets/readme_images/lighthouseIndexScoreMobile.jpg)

### Unfixed Bugs

- Column layout and sizing images to screen sizes.
  - This is an area that I am still endeavouring to conquer. My aim of having a responsive website across 3 if not 4 different screen sizes centered around a 2 section construct within the main body of the page. The top section allowed for 2 seperate column areas that could be utilised for images, text or forms. This was done will little difficulty. However, the lower section proved to be somewhat elusive for me - I was not successful in my time constraint to find the correct syntax to generate the correct behaviour. This is something that I can correct but at present, I am required to stop my search for answers in order to ensure with the rest of the site's functionalilty.

- Form Format   
  - The coding for a basic form layout was readily available in various locations so I implemented the form values from the w3school website to create my version. While I have found it to be easily responsive to the smaller screen sizes, I have not been able to successfully identify the syntax I need to evenly space the form element beside the additional text on the same page.
