## Site Structure

 The style of this site will be simple and clear due to over saturation of the fitness industry. The aim is to stand out  on our four principles and our inclusive community.
 
 It consists of 3 formatted pages consisting of a hero image, a main description surrounded by the four concept images. The next section is Classes followed by four images with location and times. This is then is followed by the footer with contact details and a google map. There is also two other pages, the other being a picture gallery and the other a sign up form

## Design Choices

### Typography
The fonts chosen for this project were 'dm-serif-display' for the headings (h1, h2 etc) and 'sans-serif' for the body text. The reason for this is that account I want to text to stand out. When you navigate to the page it stands out. Also I did not want to fill the landed page with text, I wanted to images to speak volumes in terms of community and inclusively

### Colour Scheme
The choices for the color scheme were based on examination of other like purpose sites. I wanted a contrast of dark and light across the site. I used a light background color to make the images stand out around this background color. As you can see I did ue a different background color in contrast to the body. The purpose of this was that the contact details would standout on the site and be easily located by the text and background of the footer. AS you can the text was in two colors, for the images I had the text in light color to make them stand out against the images

  - Once the site adapts for smaller screen sizes, the page logo will relocate to the center of screen with the menu options underneath it. Due to the length of some of the link names, the icons will be used instead of text when the site adapts.

## Features Left to Implement
 
This site was initially conceived as a public information resource with an option for adaptation depending on user feedback. Some of the features that are intended for the future without feedback are as follows:
 
- Official Logo for use on site and as a watermark for other associated media.
- Advice board where collected tips will be displayed.
- Animation/Pop-up of disclaimer, ensuring that the information reaches the user. 
- Self produced media content: videos and photos to replace all externally sourced content. 
- A possible link page to reputable sellers of accessories once self produced content is in place as current image licencing agreement makes this a conflict.

## Testing

In the building of the site, the major issues I had to deal with involved the following :

- Weak Design Elements
  - When I first designed the layout, I wanted to keep it clean and simplistic so that it didn't overwhelm the sensibilities of any of the users. However, the combination of 'Dela Gothic One' and 'Lora' proved to be less impactful that I thought. At the beginning of the testing phase, I was advised to rethink this approach and so the fonts "Kavoon" and "ABeeZee" were chosen to replace the original choices. 


- Menu layout and presentation on smaller viewports
  - Due to the length of the text links, I added icons to the links that would become the navigation icons when the site is viewed on a smaller screen.  This was done by adding classes to target the text and icons seperately so they could be hidden or seen as needed. Attention was required for both margin and padding settings for the various size screens but the presentation is equal across the different screen sizes.


- 'Return to Homepage' button with link to homepage
  - The main issue that I encountered with this button was the fact that I expected it to react as the Submit button did on the Tried and Tested page. After many attempts to rectify the possible link issue, I realised that I needed to treat the button layout like an imported image or icon. I used the button element and its attributes as an additional attribute of the a element that actively opens the homepage in the same browser window.


- Video Embedding
