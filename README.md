## Testing 

All features above were tested on the deployed website across multiple devices. 

All features above were tested on the deployed website on the following browsers:

- __Edge__
- __Google Chrome__
- __Brave__
- __Mozilla Firefox__

Navigation bars and links to social media websites are working as intended. The form works as it should, and the buttons perform the given actions. 

I encountered a bug when deploying the website on Mozilla Firefox for the first time, my grid structure rule for rows did not apply, I fixed the bug by removing the  "grid-template-rows", after this fix the webiste worked fine on Mozilla Firefox.

### Lighthouse testing

Because of performance levels, I have modified my images from jpg to webp following teammates' advice.

As I choose to build a recipe page with youtube video links, I could not improve the performance level.

Results for Lighthouse once fixes applied:

- __HTML__

    - __Index page__
